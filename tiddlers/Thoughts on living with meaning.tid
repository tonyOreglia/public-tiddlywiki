title: Thoughts on living with meaning
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Life is really about doing. Doing hard things. Doing new things. Learning & applying. Growing. Life is about growing. Growing & dying. Developing, passing on, passing away. We must pass something on to make all this growing and pain and development mean anything. Kids or art or legislature -- something with [[meaning]] after we die; not meaning; something that just exists & has some relevance & impact after we die. This doesn't give life meaning actually. It //is// the meaning. Fulfilling the meaning is just to render the situation sensible. To complete the puzzle. Surely happiness or a content state of mind or 'the good life' have something to do with fulfillment of some "passing on"; a life with meaning. At least as much meaning as one is capable of creating. Ozymandius and so forth. That is the catch though. If you over intellectualize it -- & realize how fleeting it is (any meaning one can generate), then we stop living. After all, once you extend the time frame long enough, human existence itself ceases to have meaning; then, what chance does one human have of doing anything worthwhile. So the only way to live is on the assumption that life on earth, this little experiment, is important. Has some meaning. human beings, as the pinnacle of developed life on earth, are important. Then you can live; what you do matters. Something I've seen before: "live as if what you do matters; it does; a lot!". From 'Feel the Fear & do it anyway". So, this is a choice. Not a result. Pure reasoning may mislead us here. To me, a true philosopher can avoid this contradiction by the belief that truth is the ultimate meaning & the only thing that really does live beyond all things we can comprehend. If one captures within the mind a deep truth; it's a unity of sorts with the universe at an incredibly deep level. So, a philosopher does not need to be depressed -- they too have their great task. Perhaps the greatest task.
