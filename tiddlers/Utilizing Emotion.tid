title: Utilizing Emotion
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The  second idea is regarding emotion. I was thinking about how to frame emotion. Emotion is like the color of one's life; but we draw the picture. Imagine an artist with an assortment of colors to work with but he draws the picture. The point is that we may not be in total control over our emotional states; but we can decide what the emotion is aimed at and what framework the emotion energizes. It's really about correct thinking so that the emotion is made useful. For example, a family man will expend anxiety worrying about the future well being of his family; whilst that same anxiety could be misused by a narcissist worrying about how one's haircut is perceived.
