Awesome French film about a group of survival enthusiasts (people convinced of some impending cataclysm and subsequent global resource shortage) that sign up for a weeklong survival training course with some Youtube guy they all follow. It's at his survival bunker deep in the middle of nowhere. It's all good until it's not. A lot of fun to watch.
