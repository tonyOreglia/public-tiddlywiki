title: Feed your mind
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

It is true that my body is not me. Over time every molecules are replaced. What does stay consistent is the structure of my mind and body. This is me. The thought and actions that come from the structure of my mind are me. The abilities that come from the structure of my body. Of course the structure does change over time. Less and less fundamentally as we get older. However, it changes in one way and one way only. That is, it changes as a reaction to the inputs. You may say it changes as a result of reflection. But this is the structure acting on itself and thus an inherent aspect. Also, you might argue that it will change in the "absence" of input, but there really is no absence. No input, is input. It's just a byte array of zeros. This is obviously bad input and the structure will essentially decay without feedback. 
The takeaway is that we must take extreme care in selecting the input we expose our minds to -- friends, reading, videos, job, relationships, where we live, etc. If we do live on in some way beyond mortality, it is insofar as the objective structure of one's mind and body does exist eternally in the world of forms. In other words, theoretically the structure could become a thing one day again; it just happens to be unlikely. But this form has an objective existence. It could in theory be described precisely and even built. Take pride in your immortal structure. Feed it only the best input that you can find. Reflect on these healthy wholesome inputs to integrate them fully into your mind/body structure.
