!! General
* Awesome Beachside walk -- from [[Praia da Azarujinha|https://goo.gl/maps/83ELmNFUYncW2Yvr6]] you can walk all the way to Caiscais. It's a really nice walk with many beaches and cafes. 
* Aquaducts - old aqueducts built in 1700s — for like 2 euros you can walk across the valley by the aqueducts. they are old and very tall structures (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81guas_Livres_Aqueduct) Aqueduto das Águas Livres. Also Reservatório da Mãe d'Água das Amoreiras is beautiful. https://goo.gl/maps/dTvUfsynyAxBpNy27
* Sintra - cool city to walk around, some castles you can tour bug book online 
* Caiscais - cool beach town, shopping, good food (check out Nova Estrela restaurante)
* Beaches - most popular surf beach is Carcavelos, Parede is our local beach; there are a lot of awesome beaches, you can't go wrong
* Belem - this is the city to get a Pastel de Nata, a traditional portuguese dessert
* Tram 28 - a great tram ride that goes through many nice parts of the city and some lookout points. You have to do it early though as it gets crowded
* nice viewpoint here https://goo.gl/maps/F8UnJPEw5LzUU5gq6


!! Bars / Night Life

For the night life, you want to start at Pink Street just to see it, but then go to Bairro Alto for the real Portuguese night life. This part of the city parties all night and has many fun bars.
Here is a great rooftop bar with views for a sunny day -- "Park Rooftop" :  https://goo.gl/maps/6uMzXFioRgZoLYp18
