History, science and philosophy are the three classifications of theoretical work. If a theoretical work pertains to things outside your own experience it is likely a scientific work. Otherwise it is likely philosophical.

It is a mansion having many rooms, rooms on different levels, of different sizes and shapes, with different outlooks, with different uses. The rooms are independent, in part. Each has its own structure and interior decoration. But they are not absolutely independent and separate. They are connected by doors and arches, by corridors and stairways ... as houses are more or less livable, so books are more or less readable. The best books are the ones that have the most intelligible structure.&quot; (pg. 77)
