<div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><h1 class="">Work in Progress </h1><h1 class="">Chapter 1</h1><p>Division of labour is responsible for the greatest improvements in production. Division of labour contributes in three ways</p><ol><li>Increases individual dexterity</li><li>Reduce task switching</li><li>Facilitation of automation</li></ol><p>Incredible number of people work in combination to produce even simple products. </p><h1 class="">Chapter 2 - Of the Principle Which Gives Occasion to the Division of Labour</h1><ul><li>Propensity to trade leads to specialization which leads to division of labour</li><li>Humans must rely on trade amongst each other</li><li>These specializations give rise to different types of people. This is very useful for trade.</li></ul><h1 class="">Chapter 3 - That the Division of Labour is Limited by the Extend of the Market</h1><ul><li>The market is the bottleneck for the division of labour</li><li>Water navigation offers great market multiplier <ul><li>Large inland territories usually have a small market and thus a lesser division of labour</li></ul></li></ul><h1 class="">Chapter 4 - Of the Origin and Use of Money</h1><ul><li>Trade results in the need to find an easily trade-able good. Metal fits this need; eventually the metal is stamped to certify it. This certification essentially becomes the only thing necessary, resulting in a coin or devaluation of the metal. The is currency. </li><li>Practical Value = the value of an object in use</li><li>Value of Exchange = the purchasing power of an object. </li><li>Practical Value and Value of Exchange correlate inversely</li></ul><h2 class="">Chapter 5, 6 and 7 Investigate the principles of exchangeable value</h2><h1 class="">Chapter 5 - Of the Real and Nominal Price of Commodities, or of their Price in Labour, and Their Price in Money </h1><ul><li>Labour is the ultimate value of all things</li><li>Corn is linked with labour very closely and it thus holds it's real value relatively stable</li></ul><h1 class="">Chapter 6 - Of the Component Part of the Price of Commodities </h1><ul><li>Revenue is derived from three possible sources<ol><li>Wages from labour </li><li>Profits from stock</li><li>Rent form land</li></ol></li><li>Labour of &quot;inspection and direction&quot; i.e. management creates profits proportional to the stock employed. Thus, more stock result in larger profits. </li></ul><h1 class="">Chapter 7 - Of the Natural and Market Price of Commodities</h1><h2 class="">definitions</h2><dl><dt>natural Price</dt><dd>when price of commodity perfectly covers the rent, wages and profits needed to produce it.</dd><dt>market price</dt><dd>the actual price for which any commodity is sold</dd><dt>effectual demand</dt><dd>demand for commodity at it's natural price</dd></dl><ul><li>Market prices deviate from natural price in response to supply and demand</li><li>monopoly, legislation, trade secrets can all effect supply and demand and thus the market price</li><li>changes in market prices fall mainly on wages and profit. Not as much on rent. </li></ul><h2 class="">Chapter 8, 9, 10 and 11 explain the causes of the variations in natural price caused by variations in rate of wages, profit and rent. </h2><h1 class="">Chapter 8 - Of the Wages of Labour: Explanation of variation in wages </h1><ul><li>In the battle of unions vs employers, unions are at a disadvantage</li><li>Increasing natural wealth results in increasing revenue/stock which results in demand for wage labour<ul><li>it is the rate of growth that matters, not the absolute value. Therefor, increase in country population is usually indicative of prosperity</li></ul></li><li>Slow growth results in low wages</li><li>Decline in growth results in starvation</li><li>Labour wages tend to be more stable than price of provisions. Why? Because increasing cost of provisions results in less demand for labour which decreases wages. However increase in cost of provision also tends to raise wages directly. </li></ul><h1 class="">Chapter 9 - Of the Profits of Stock: Explanation of variation in rate of profit</h1><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The rise and fall in the profits of stock depend upon the same causes with the rise and fall in the wages of labour, the increasing or declining state of the wealth of the society; but those causes affect the one and the other very differently
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>wherever a great deal can be made by the use of money, a great deal will commonly be given for the use of it; and that, wherever little can be made by it, less will commonly be given for it.
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>the diminution of profit is the natural effect of its prosperity
</p></blockquote><ul><li>Increasing stock means decreasing profits which means lower interest rates and increasing wages. </li></ul><h1 class="">Chapter 10 - Of Wages and Profit in the Different Employments of Labour and Stock (Explanation of the variance in natural prices) </h1><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The whole of the advantages and disadvantages of the different employments of labour and stock, must, in the same neighbourhood, be either perfectly equal, or continually tending to equality....This, at least, would be the case....where there was perfect liberty, and where every man was perfectly free both to choose what occupation he thought proper, and to change it as often as he though proper.
</p></blockquote><p>Two parts to chapter 10: Explanation of variance in wages and profit due to </p><ol><li>nature of employment </li><li>policy of Europe (&quot;which nowhere leaves things at perfect liberty&quot;)</li></ol><h2 class="">Part I - Inequalities arising from the nature of the employment themselves </h2><ul><li>There are five principal wage drivers<ol><li>agreeableness of the employment</li><li>easiness and cheapness of learning it </li><li>constancy of employment</li><li>trust required to those employed in this role</li><li>probability of success</li></ol></li><li>In Order for equality of labour advantages to arise, 3 requisites: <ol><li>employments must be well known and long established</li><li>the employment must be in it's ordinary state </li><li>must be the sole employment of those who occupy the roles (part time workers will work for less than is fair) </li></ol></li></ul><h2 class="">Part II - Inequalities occasioned by the Policy of Europe</h2><ul><li>Europe legislation disturbs liberty of the market in three ways<ol><li>Restraining the competition to a smaller number </li></ol><ul><li>incorporated trades, apprenticeship laws</li></ul><ol><li>Increasing the competition beyond what it would naturally be</li></ol><ul><li>pensions, scholarships, etc. </li></ul><ol><li>obstructing the free circulation of labour and stock (both between employments and between places)</li></ol><ul><li>parish laws stop people moving between places</li></ul></li></ul><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation end in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. 
</p></blockquote><h1 class="">Chapter 11 - Of the Rent of Land (Explanation of the variance in natural prices) </h1><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Rent, considered as the price paid for the use of land, is naturally the highest which the tenant can afford to pay in the actual circumstances of the land.
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>High of low wages and profit are the causes of high or low price; high or low rent is the effect of it.
</p></blockquote><p>Chapter is split into three parts</p><ol><li>land that always affords rent</li><li>land that sometimes affords rent</li><li>variance in the relative value between 1 and 2</li></ol><h2 class="">Part 1: Of the Produce of Land which always affords rent </h2><ul><li>In a developed country, most land is developed for feeding people or animals â€“ the rent and profit from this regulates rent/profit for all other cultivated land. </li></ul><h2 class="">Part 2: Of the Produce of Land, which sometimes does, and sometimes does not, afford Rent</h2><h3 class="">Human food seems to be the only produce of land, which always and necessarily affords some rent to the landlord. Other sorts of produce sometimes may, and sometimes may not, according to different circumstances. </h3><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>But when, by the improvement and cultivation of land, the labour of one family can provide food for two, the labour of half the society becomes sufficient to provide food for the whole. The other half, therefore, or at least the greater part of them, can be employed in providing other things, or in satisfying the other wants and fancies of mankind
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The desire of food is limited in every man by the narrow capacity of the human stomach; but the desire of the conveniences and ornaments of building, dress, equipage, and household furniture, seems to have no limit or certain boundary. Those, therefore, who have the command of more food than they themselves can consume, are always willing to exchange the surplus, or, what is the same thing, the price of it, for gratifications of this other kind. 
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The demand for them [other parts [not food] of the produce of land] is not always such as to afford a greater price than what is sufficient to pay the labour, and replace, together with its ordinary profits.
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>The merit of their beauty is greatly enhanced by their scarcity. With the greater part of rich people, the chief enjoyment of riches consists in the parade of riches; which in their eye, is never so complete as when they appear to posses those decisive marks of opulence which nobody can possess but themselves.
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Whatever increases the fertility of land in producing food, increases not only the value of lands upon which the improvement is bestowed, but contributes likewise to increase that of many other lands, by creating a new demand for their produce.That abundance of food, of which, in consequence of the improvement of land, many people have the disposal beyond what they themselves can consume, is the great cause of the demand, both for the precious metals and the precious stones, as well as for every other conveniency and ornament of dress, lodging, household furniture and equipage. Food not only constitutes the principal part of the riches of the world, but it is the abundance of food which gives the principal part of their value to many other sorts of riches.
</p></blockquote><p>Other sources of rent (not food) do not always afford rent:
* coal mines
* metallic mines
* wood / coal </p><h2 class="">Part 3: Of the variations in the Proportion between the respective Values of that sort of Produce which always affords Rent, and of that which sometimes does, and sometimes does not, afford Rent</h2><p>i.e. ratio of food rent to not-food rent </p><p>As society progresses, &quot;not food&quot; _should_ increase in value in proportion to increases in abundance of food. However, in some cases, the &quot;not food&quot; has increased in abundance faster than this increase in demand. This is the case in most cases, except a few. </p><p>110 PAGE DIVERSION concerning the variations in the value of silver during the course of the four centuries prior to the writing of this book! </p><p>The low money price of some particular good (cattle, poultry, game of all kinds) in proportion to that of corn is a decisive indication of the poverty of the times. It shows that there is great abundance in proportion to corn. </p><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>It is the natural effect of improvement, however, to diminish gradually the real price of almost all manufactures ... in consequence of better machinery, of greater dexterity, and more proper division and distribution of work.
</p></blockquote><h2 class="">Conclusion of the Chapter </h2><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Every improvement in the circumstances of the society tends, either directly or indirectly, to raise the real rent of land to increase the real wealth of the landlord, his power of purchasing the labour, or the produce of the labour of other people.
</p></blockquote><blockquote class="tc-quote"><p>Every increase in the real wealth of the society, every increase in the quantity of useful labour employed within it, tends indirectly to raise the real rend of land.
</p></blockquote><p>The entire produce of a country divides into three parts: </p><ol><li>rent of land </li><li>wages of labour</li><li>profits of stock </li></ol><p>Giving revenue to </p><ol><li>those who live by rent</li><li>those who live by wages</li><li>those who live by profit </li></ol><p>the interest of those living by rent and wages are aligned with the interests of society. The interests of the profiteers are always in some degree different from (even opposite to) that of the public. </p></div>
